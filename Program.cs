            //excel is two dimensional array , we have two directions of indexing, 
            //two dimesnionalAray-We have two numbers that identify a given cell ;
            //TryDimensionalArray --example a Cube ->  we have tree dimensions, three numerations of indexes 
            //on which we can walk on -> every cell has 3 indexes;//every cell has indexing of three dimensions
            //multidimenional array = array with more than inclusive 2 Dimenensions//more than one Dimension;
            //twoDimensional Array is called Matrix, or Tables/--example Excel Table is two dimesnional Array/
            //three DimensionalArray indexsation of cells is into three directions , indexing by rows, indexing by colomns, 
            //indexing by Depth--example of Three dimensional Array is th cube !!!!
            //

            //Example oneDimesionalArray :
            int[] numbers = new int[5]; //this is one dimensional Array consisting of 5 elements;
            //Example of twoDimesnionalArray called, matrix, or table, example is an excel table;
            int[,] numberS = new int[5,10]; //two dimesnional array,  5rows and  10 columns;
            //the comma into [ , ] says that the array is here two dimesnional !
